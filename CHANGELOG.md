### Ashen Crown page-enrichment and shell pass
- standardized major player-facing pages around page flavor text plus a dedicated CIEL guidance panel
- upgraded Home, City, Travel, Academies, Education, Adventure, Inventory, Market, Guilds, Consortiums, Estate Office, Black Market, Hospital, Bank, Contacts, Skills, Achievements, and Profile to use the same voice and structure
- introduced shared CIEL page copy, city copy, empty-state microcopy, and rotating quote data for broader reuse
- polished the shell by wiring public top-bar navigation, aligning sidebar branding with Ashen Crown as the world brand and Nexis as the shard/capital context, and adding a sidebar CIEL quote strip
- player impact: the game now reads more like a coherent browser RPG instead of a collection of disconnected placeholder panels
- risk level: low to moderate, because the pass is mostly UI and copy integration but touches shared shell components
- follow-up: run a clean GitHub-backed build verification, resolve any remaining stale metadata such as package-lock naming, and deploy only from the AshenCrown repository
